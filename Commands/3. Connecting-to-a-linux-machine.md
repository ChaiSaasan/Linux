## Connecting to a linux machine
    
### Prerequisite
    
    #OpenSSH-server should be installed in the linux machine
    #Enable SSH
    #Open port 22

    #Commands:
    sudo apt install openssh-server
    sudo systemctl enable ssh
    sudo ufw allow ssh

### Connecting to a linux machine is quiet simple
    
    SSH username@host-ip-or-name
    SSH tries to authenticate the server using the server's public host keys saved in the known_hosts file when first logged-in. If they do not match, server terminates the connection. If it is first time, ssh displays a warning with server's public host key to verify.
    
    
### SSH Handshake process and known_hosts
    Very good explaination on this can be found here: https://goteleport.com/blog/ssh-handshake-explained/

    General steps:
        1. TCP handshake
        2. Sharing Algorithm information to each other
        3. Client Diffie Helmen key exchange - Client public key is shared
        4. Server computes the Diffie Helmen key. Server Diffie Helmen Key exchange - Sends Server public key, Server host key, Signature
        5. Client validates the saved host key. Client computes the Diffie Hellmen key. Client generates signature and validates the signature for integrity(to prevent MITM attacks).
        6. Both the sides generates 6 set of keys - 2 encryption keys, 2 IV, 2 Integrity keys
        7. Not clear how the above keys are generated and use of that many number of keys. However, finally both client and server agree upon the keys and communicate over an encrypted channel.


### SSHKeygen
    One can create SSH keys using the below command:
        sshkeygen

    To upload the generated key to SSH server, use the below command:
        ssh-copy-id <username>@<host-ip-or-name>

    Next time the user login using ssh command, user doesn't have to enter password.
